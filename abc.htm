    Here, we have created a random folder called "localRepo", now when we enter here, and do "  ls -a  " it will show only  " . "  &  "  ..  " and no " .git ", so we need to do "git init" thereafter it will be linked to github and show " .git "  as well


    Now after it is linked to git, we can perform "add" operation to stage the changes and subsequently do commit, however, since it is not yet linked to a "remote repository" on github, commits made will be local, so the various commits or this code will be available locally only, to link it to "remote repo" on github, we do     "  git remote add origin LINK_OF_REMOTE_REPO  "
