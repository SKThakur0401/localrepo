    Here, we have created a random folder called "localRepo", now when we enter here, and do "  ls -a  " it will show only  " . "  &  "  ..  " and no " .git ", so we need to do "git init" thereafter it will be linked to github and show " .git "  as well


    Now after it is linked to git, we can perform "add" operation to stage the changes and subsequently do commit, however, since it is not yet linked to a "remote repository" on github, commits made will be local, so the various commits or this code will be available locally only, to link it to "remote repo" on github, we do     "  git remote add origin LINK_OF_REMOTE_REPO  "
    (You can create a new repo and use its link to copy paste this code on that rep :)

    here we are linking to "    https://github.com/SKThakur0401/localrepo.git   "

    now after linking, u can do " git branch " and it will tell you the name of all the branches, initially there'll be only "master" branch by default but u want to work on main branch, so u'll change the name of branch by typing this   "  git branch -M main  " now name of your branch is changed to "main"

    So if you do " git branch " now, it will show "main",

    now u can do "  git push origin main  " and it will be pushed to the remote repository on the internet


    Now, till now we have only worked on "main" branch, in real life, multiple branches of a project can be created, 

    command to create a new branch :  "  git checkout -b feature1  "


    command to access another branch :  "  git checkout feature1  "

    So after this command you are in "feature1" branch and not in "main" branch!! any change u make here will be reflected as in feature1

    u can change your branch and go to some other branch like "XYZ" branch by typing "  git checkout XYZ  "

    now, when u are in say "feature1" branch, and then the changes made by u in code will only be reflected on the feature1 branch, when you change the branch, the text will also change according to the branch

    The text above is only available in feature1 branch!

    Now if you want to delete a branch command is : "git -d feature2"
    This will delete a branch

    Now, if you want to see difference b/w two branches:
        Say now you are in "feature1" branch, you can type "git diff main" here, it will show difference b/w "feature1" and "main" branch

        Merging two branches:
        You can merge two branches by      "  git merge main  "

        Other way is using "github" you can create a "pull request (PR) ", this technique is used when multiple developers are working on the same project, and you want your feature to merge with the main branch, so you will create a "PR" and a senior developer will view those changes, and it will be merged with the main branch if the changes made by you are good enough...


        Now when your pull request is accepted, or here, you are the only one working so u can accept your pull request on your own, in that case the changes made by you will be reflected on github! BUT! that is your remote repository and if you want those changes to be copied on your local repo, i.e. your vs code, you need to do "  git pull origin main  " by this, data from your remote repository will be copied to your local repo(ie your computer/vscode)


        what is fork?
        Forking is the process where we copy an entire repository and then we can have another name for that copy, we can copy someone else's repository and make changes in the copy we have created,
